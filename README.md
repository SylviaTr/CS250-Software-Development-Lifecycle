•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think user needs should not be interpreted too much as you never know if that is what the user needs. I think that is why user stories are so important, they don’t leave much room for interpretation. They should be very clear and to the point. If there are any questions left open, the development team should put questions for clarification together and the product owner should either answer them, if he/she knows the answers or he/she should meet with the customer to clarify and have those questions answered. Once requirements and needs are clear they can be implemented into the program.


•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

First I have to get all the requirements for the project from customer, preferably in form of user stories, then I have to make sure those user stories are clear and if not, I have to clarify those questions I still have. Then I have to decide which method I want to use. There are 5 methods that are commonly used in software development: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (EP), Lean Development and Crystal.
If we take for example Scrum (which I have most experience in due to this course), I would then plan and start working on the project (Sprints, daily sprints, Review, Retrospective, etc.).


•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member you have to give it your best to ensure an overall success of the whole team. Important characteristics are: responsibility, reliability, collaboration, good communication skills, motivation, initiative, good social skills etc. You have to put the common goal of the team over your individual goals. You work as a team, so either you are all successful as a team or fail as a team. That sometimes requires picking up extra work and helping other team members. Also, there should be no finger pointing and blame shifting.
